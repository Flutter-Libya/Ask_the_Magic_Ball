## Usage

After launching the app, you will see a Magic Ball displayed on the screen. To receive an answer to your question, simply tap on the Magic Ball. The answer will be generated randomly, and the image of the Magic Ball will change accordingly. There are a total of five possible responses that can be displayed.

To include the images in the project, make sure they are located in the `images/` directory within the project folder. The image names should be as follows:
